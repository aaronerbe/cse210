You have been hired by an event planning company. They help organize and market events throughout the world. They need you to write a program to track each of these events and produce the marketing material to distribute on social media. They typically handle a few main types of events:

    -Lectures, which have a speaker and have a limited capacity.
    -Receptions, which require people to RSVP, or register, beforehand.
    -Outdoor gatherings, which do not have a limit on attendees, but need to track the weather forecast.

All events need:
    -Event Title 
    -Description
    -Date 
    -Time
    -Address

They would like the ability to generate three different messages:
    1.  Standard details - Lists the   
        title
        description
        date
        time
        address
    2.  Full details - Lists all of the above +
        -type of event
        -Event Specific Info: 
            -For lectures:
                -speaker name
                -capacity
            -For receptions:
                -email for RSVP
            -For outdoor:
                -weather
    3.  Short description - Lists the 
        -type of event 
        -title
        -date

Program Specification
    Write a program that has a base Event class along with derived classes for each type of event. These classes should contain the necessary data and provide methods to return strings for each of the messages the company desires.

    Remember that any data or methods that are common among all types of events should be in the base class.

    Once you have the classes in place, write a program that creates at least one event of each type and sets all of their values. Then, for event event, call each of the methods to generate the marketing messages and output their results to the screen.

In addition, your program must:

Use inheritance to avoid duplicating shared attributes and methods.
Use an address class for the addresses.
Follow the principles of encapsulation, making sure each member variable is private.
